This is my version of the model to detect deep fakes
The process to create it is described in the IEEE paper titled  Deep Fake Face Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
I have given the paper in the repository as well.
The preprocess.py I have converted the images to grayscale and adjusted the brightness of each image using CLAHE.
The model is incomplete I implemented is incompleted for now
